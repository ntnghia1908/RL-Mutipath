Prerequisites
- Python 3.7.4
- Pip 20.0.2
- Tensorflow 2.2.0
- Matplotlib 3.1.1
- Numpy 1.18.4
- Pandas 1.0.3
- Network data have to be downloaded and add to Network_data/{folder}/{network_data} before it can be used to
seperate and train model
Generate data trace
- Before training the model data must be preprocess into pickle files by running
`python3 generate_trace`
Training
- To train new model, make sure bitrate_list and video_list have been generated in prior step. Then run
`python3 rl_gym`
- The training process will takes around 1 hour to fully complete depend on machine
- Model params after training is store under folder model/ as h5 files
Evaluating
- run `python3 plot` to generate overview of training process (on reward)
- run `python3 evaluate` to generate an overall performance cdf
- run `python3 evaluate_sep` to generate an overview of average performance bar chart of all method
